The "Features" directory should be used for our code that may be reused on other sites but may not be released to the general public as a plugin.

= "Features" will be a main level admin item
	= A features plugi once actvated will appear here and have all its coresponding theme options availble.
= Typically these will have to be able to be used in a Network Environment.
